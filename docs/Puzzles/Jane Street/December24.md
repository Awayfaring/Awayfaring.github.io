Oh no! The elves in charge of board games only managed to complete a couple of sets before they were distracted by playtesting the toys. Ho-ho-ho-w infuriating!

<summary>Solution  </summary>
First and foremost we see that the game pieces form letters.
Using the game boxes/instructions in the back, we order the letter the game pieces form.

- **UNO**: M
- **Catan**: I
- **Risk**: S
- **Monopoly**: S
- **Dominion**: I
- **Scrabble**: N
- **Sushi Go**: G
- **Chess**: O
- **Clue**: N
- **Stratego**: E
- **Bananagrams**: S

We can see that the letters form the word "MISSINGONES", and upon caferul observation you can realize that each of displayed pieces, have one "object" missing.

Take UNO, UNO has 4 "categories" of cards, 
- Red
- Yellow
- Green
- Blue

With a quick observation we can see that no Yellow cards were used in the construction of the "M".

We take that principle and apply it to the other games categories.
- **UNO**: Green, Blue, Red, *Yellow*
- **Catan**: Has 5 resource cards, of which *Ore* is missing.
- **Risk**: All the teal colored are Asian countries/regions, of which *Ural* is missing
- **Monopoly**: _____
- **Dominion**: Of the 7 Base resouce cards *Silver* is missing.
- **Scrabble**: Of the 26 letters, *U* is Missing
- **Sushi Go**: Of the base set cards the *Nigiri* card is missing.
- **Chess**: The *Kings* for both black and white are missing.
- **Clue**: _____
- **Stratego**: They have an older version of Stratego of which 8 -> *Miner* is missing.
- **Bananagrams**: Is Missing the letter Y.

After a bit of looking you will realize that Monopoly and clue have no missing pieces and that would be correct.
Inside our final answer we will treat those 2 as "Spaces".

In the order I presented (which was the same order in which we derived "MISSING ONES"), reading the first letter of every missing "one" would give us the phrase

**"YOU SUNK MY _"**

Upon a quick search we find that **"Battleship"** is the missing word, and also our final answer.
