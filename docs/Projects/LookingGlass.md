### Quick Introduction

This project was developed by me and 3 other people for a Synaptech, a club at UW. We sought to answer the question "How do people process images of strangers vs familiar people differently?". Over the course of a year we created a repeatable experiment, created/gathered the necessary hardware and software and ran tests to gather data. In the end we were able to cumulate our findings into a poster which we presented at a research symposium at UW.

### My Story
<details markdown="block">
<summary>Solution  </summary>
Looking Glass," a project I've been part of since September 2024, exemplifies my ability to design and implement complex experiments, particularly in neuroscience.

My primary role involved creating the experiment's core: investigating how neural activity changes when subjects view familiar or unfamiliar faces. This included developing a sophisticated Python algorithm capable of realistically morphing two faces.

I, along with a fellow team member, developed a robust pipeline for recording and synchronizing EEG and eye tracker data from users, ensuring precise data collection. Furthermore, I used JavaScript to implement an engaging user interface that displays a random selection of familiar, stranger, and morphed faces to participants. The project culminated in the creation and presentation of a poster detailing our findings at a research symposium. This artifact underscores my skills in Python and JavaScript, data acquisition, algorithmic development for scientific applications, and effectively communicating research outcomes.
