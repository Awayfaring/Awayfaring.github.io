### Quick Introduction


In the "Original" image above there are 2 distinct colors, a bright green which is puromycin a protein, and a red which is neurofilament. 
The researchers we worked with believed that in CMT neurons are not producing certain proteins which results in the very distinct "red" without any "green" around it. Our project which collaborated with these scientists was to create a method that highlighted where these faulty axons are, to use in other settings like calculating florescence. In the above image, the blue within the "processed image" is what our method highlighted.

### My Takeaways
<details markdown="block">
<summary>Solution  </summary>
I did some work as an Undergraduate Research Assistant from October 2024 to March 2025 directly led to the development of the "Neuron Imaging" projet.  My core contribution was developing a Python algorithm to highlight axons within fluorescent images of neurons, a significant advancement that eliminated the need for manual tracing. Beyond this, I worked with a teammate to create a method that effectively eliminates noise within these images,  drastically improving data quality and processing efficiency. This algorithm was subsequently integrated into a larger pipeline capable of processing hundreds of images rapidly, extracting  information such as axon length and fluorescence. This artifact demonstrates my strong command of Python, my ability to design and implement efficient algorithms for scientific data processing, and my capacity to contribute to meaningful research outcomes. It showcases my problem-solving skills in enhancing data quality and automating labor-intensive tasks within a research environment.
