Solution for Part 1 Immediately we are presented with a few pieces of information. | We know the calculator is broken so we shouldn’t expect anything to work right. | We are restricted to using the following keys: 8, 5, 3, +, - , =, C | We need to somehow use the numbers to calculate 20. | . The first thing I did was to calculate the following . | Calculation | Result | . | 3 + 3 = | 4 | . | 3 - 3 = | 4 | . | 5 + 5 = | 49 | . | 5 - 5 = | 14 | . | 8 + 8 = | 100 | . | 3 + 5 = | 14 | . | 5 + 8 = | 70 | . From these calculations you can make 2 observations . Observation 1: . It is likely that . 3 maps to 2 . 5 maps to 7 . 8 maps to 10 . Observation 2: . + performs the operation of * . - performs thr operation of + . From this we can conclude that 8 - 8 which is really 10 + 10 will give us our desired answer. Part 2 . Solution for Part 1 &lt;/details&gt; . Part 3 . Solution for Part 1 &lt;/details&gt; . ",

    "content": "Puzzle Link . Oh no! The elves in charge of board games only managed to complete a couple of sets before they were distracted by playtesting the toys. Ho-ho-ho-w infuriating! . [The answer to this puzzle is a single word.] . Original Puzzle Link . Here I will have the steps in which I do the puzzle, I will have drop downs including each of the steps, and the results. Solution First and foremost we see that the game pieces form letters. Using the game boxes/instructions in the back, we order the letter the game pieces form. | UNO: M | Catan: I | Risk: S | Monopoly: S | Dominion: I | Scrabble: N | Sushi Go: G | Chess: O | Clue: N | Stratego: E | Bananagrams: S | . We can see that the letters form the word “MISSINGONES”, and upon caferul observation you can realize that each of displayed pieces, have one “object” missing. Take UNO, UNO has 4 “categories” of cards, . | Red | Yellow | Green | Blue | . With a quick observation we can see that no Yellow cards were used in the construction of the “M”. We take that principle and apply it to the other games categories. | UNO: Green, Blue, Red, Yellow | Catan: Has 5 resource cards, of which Ore is missing. | Risk: All the teal colored are Asian countries/regions, of which Ural is missing | Monopoly: _____ | Dominion: Of the 7 Base resouce cards Silver is missing. | Scrabble: Of the 26 letters, U is Missing | Sushi Go: Of the base set cards the Nigiri card is missing. | Chess: The Kings for both black and white are missing. | Clue: _____ | Stratego: They have an older version of Stratego of which 8 -&gt; Miner is missing. | Bananagrams: Is Missing the letter Y. | . After a bit of looking you will realize that Monopoly and clue have no missing pieces and that would be correct. Inside our final answer we will treat those 2 as “Spaces”. In the order I presented (which was the same order in which we derived “MISSING ONES”), reading the first letter of every missing “one” would give us the phrase . “YOU SUNK MY _“ . Upon a quick search we find that “Battleship” is the missing word, and also our final answer. ",

We sought to answer the question “How do people process images of strangers vs familiar people differently?”. Over the course of a year we created the entire project, ran tests and gathered data, and presented our data at a research presentation at UW. My Story . Solution Looking Glass,” a project I’ve been part of since September 2024, exemplifies my ability to design and implement complex experiments, particularly in neuroscience. My primary role involved creating the experiment’s core: investigating how neural activity changes when subjects view familiar or unfamiliar faces. This included developing a sophisticated Python algorithm capable of realistically morphing two faces. I, along with a fellow team member, developed a robust pipeline for recording and synchronizing EEG and eye tracker data from users, ensuring precise data collection. Furthermore, I used JavaScript to implement an engaging user interface that displays a random selection of familiar, stranger, and morphed faces to participants. The project culminated in the creation and presentation of a poster detailing our findings at a research symposium. This artifact underscores my skills in Python and JavaScript, data acquisition, algorithmic development for scientific applications, and effectively communicating research outcomes. ",

    "title": "Link to the Hunt, includes checker",
    "content": "This puzzle hunt has 9 parts, 8 feeder parts and 1 META. Below I will have my approach along with the solution for each of the puzzles. 1. Alter Rivals . Link to Customer 1 . Approach and Solution Looking past the converstion between the “Customer” and “You”. We are greeted by the main body of the puzzle, which in this case happens to be a block of text. Skimming thorugh the text 2 things immediately stand out . | Almost nothing is capitalized, The first word of every sentence is lowercase, the pronoun “I” which is always uppercase is never capitalized in this block of text. | Since a majority of the text is lowercase the words that are capitalized stand out greatly. | . As such I decided to focus on these select words/letters. They are the following: . | Visa | Boeing | Omega | AT&amp;T | Duracell | MegaBloks | . My first instinct was to take the letters that were capitalized (i.e V from Visa) and see if they form anything meaningful. Unfortunatley the letters “VBOATTDM”, or “VBOADM”/”VBOTDM” (Using only the A or T from AT&amp;T) didn’t anagram or decipher into any meaningful words. After a period of thinking I noticed a detail I glossed over earlier. All of the aforementioned words were large brands/companies, using the hint provided by the title of the puzzle I decided to look into the “rivals” of these companies. Here I compiled a list. | Visa: American Express, MasterCard, Discover | Boeing: Airbus | Omega: Rolex, Patek, Breitling | AT&amp;T: T-Mobile, Version | Duracell: Energizer, Panasonic | MegaBloks: Lego | . Taking the first letter of the categories I’m fairly certain in we have: . _ A _ _ _ L . After some guess and check, the only word I got that made any sense was . MARVEL . In which you select, MasterCard, Airbus, Rolex, Verison, Energizer, Lego. Marvel however is not yet the answer. Using the “Alter Rivals” theme provided by the title we find the “rival” for Marvel which is DC also known as DC Comics . 2. Parallel Enclousures . Link to Customer 2 . 3. Company Timpani . Link to Customer 3 . Approach and Solution This part was easy, just some wordplay . | Reimburse (Pay) &amp; Friend (Pal) -&gt; PayPal | Slime (Goo) &amp; Seabird (Gull) -&gt; Google | First name of Hermione (Emma) &amp; Boy child of Father (Son) -&gt; Amazon | Phone Downloadable (App) &amp; Boat Shell (Hull) -&gt; Apple | Really Tiny (Micro) &amp; Fluffy (Soft) -&gt; Microsoft | British Fool (Twit) &amp; Sound of Hesitation (Uhh) -&gt; Twitter | Chains are like this (Linked) &amp; Not out (in) -&gt; LinkedIn | Not me (You) &amp; Cylinder (Tube) -&gt; Youtube | . The numbers on the right side I assumed represented the letter we took in the word. \\ . | PayPal(1) -&gt; P | Google(3) -&gt; O | Amazon(2) -&gt; M | Apple(1) -&gt; A | Microsoft(2) -&gt; I | Twitter(2) -&gt; W | Linkedin(2) -&gt; I | Youtube(5) -&gt; U | . However this doesnt make any sense, so back to the drawing board. This time around I pay more attention to the provided flavor text. In the conversation it seems that the individual we are trying to help is in some convention with many CEO’s that “don’t even seem to know the names of their companies”. This makes me believe that rather the number is referring to a letter within the name of the CEO rather than the company. Doing a little research (remember the year that this was made is 2013), here are the CEOs for the companies above . | PayPal -&gt; Peter Thiel(1) -&gt; P | Google -&gt; Larry Page(3) -&gt; R | Amazon -&gt; Jeff Bezos(2) -&gt; E | Apple -&gt; Tim Cook(1) -&gt; T | Microsoft(2) -&gt; Steve Ballmer -&gt; T | Twitter(2) -&gt; Dick Costolo -&gt; I | Linkedin(2) -&gt; Jeff Weiner -&gt; E | Youtube(5) -&gt; Salar Kamangar -&gt; R | . The letters we extracted spells PRETTIER which is the answer for this part. Customer 4: Consolidations . Link to Customer 4 . Approach and Solution Reading the flavor text for this puzzle is vital, the character representing “us” replies “..Do you mean the year 2000” in response to the other character saying they only recognize consoles made after 1111101000. With this in mind, I marked all consoles made after the year . Treating the areas marked as 1 and those not as 0, we can extract the following binary strings from the image . | 01110 -&gt; 14 | 01001 -&gt; 9 | 01110 -&gt; 14 | 10100 -&gt; 20 | 00101 -&gt; 5 | 01110 -&gt; 14 | 00100 -&gt; 4 | 01111 -&gt; 15 | . Now taking using a 1-indexed alphabet the numbers correspond to N I N T E N D O. HOWEVER, this is not the correct solution, entering this into the checker will result in a special message telling you to look closer. The only thing that makes sense would be to go through a similar process except this time we mark every console that was made by Nintendo. Doing the same extraction we end up with our final answer: Headache . Customer 5: Pneumatic Pneumonia . Link to Customer 5 . Customer 6: Cattlegories . Link to Customer 6 . Approach and Solution In my opinion the easiest of the puzzles. The puzzle’s title and flavor text clues us that the theme would about cuts of meat. Immediately here is what I got: . | Picture of Chuck Norris -&gt; Chuck Steak | Picture of Shoulder -&gt; Shoulder | Picture of Burger (Filet O Fish) -&gt; Filet | Picture of Skirt -&gt; Skirt Steak | Picture of Circle -&gt; Round | Picture of Map (flank maneuver) -&gt; Flank Steak | . After a bit of research the weird tools displayed are referred to as Shank, which also happens to be a cut of meat. I also found that for the pottery picture the tools displayed are called Ribs which also refers to a cut of meat . Following the same pattern as before, we use the number inside each image to extract the corresponding letter inside the word. After doing that and arranging them left to right, top to bottom we are left with our final answer Ranchero . Customer 7: Contents Included . Link to Customer 7 . Approach and Solution This problem is very straightforward, the flavor text hints that the individual is entertained by something, using this information and the fact that this puzzle is called Contents Included I made the assumption that the “flashcards” give us the content of a certain game/activity and we need to guess them. Here’s what I got for each of them, left to right, top to bottom. I also highlighted the letter that would fall in the box . | Checkers | Barrel O’ Monkeys | Monopoly | Hungry Hungry Hippos | Mousetrap | Taboo | Battleship | Bananagrams | . Using the highlighted (unfortunately it doesn’t really stand out) letters we get our final answer: CANISTER . Customer 8: Tournament of Numbers . Link to Customer 8 . META . Link to META . ",

In the “Original” image above there are 2 distinct colors, a bright green which is puromycin a protein, and a red which is neurofilament. The researchers we worked with believed that in CMT neurons are not producing certain proteins which results in the very distinct “red” without any “green” around it. Our project which collaborated with these scientists was to create a method that highlighted where these faulty axons are, to use in other settings like calculating florescence. In the above image, the blue within the “processed image” is what our method highlighted. — . My Takeaways . Solution I did some work as an Undergraduate Research Assistant from October 2024 to March 2025 directly led to the development of the “Neuron Imaging” projet. My core contribution was developing a Python algorithm to highlight axons within fluorescent images of neurons, a significant advancement that eliminated the need for manual tracing. Beyond this, I worked with a teammate to create a method that effectively eliminates noise within these images, drastically improving data quality and processing efficiency. This algorithm was subsequently integrated into a larger pipeline capable of processing hundreds of images rapidly, extracting information such as axon length and fluorescence. This artifact demonstrates my strong command of Python, my ability to design and implement efficient algorithms for scientific data processing, and my capacity to contribute to meaningful research outcomes. It showcases my problem-solving skills in enhancing data quality and automating labor-intensive tasks within a research environment. ",

    "content": "A niche technique for solving certain integrals that involves having the entire integral as a function of a newly created parameter . Not to be confused with Feynman’s Technique or Feynman Parametrization. In fact this method was originally derived by Leibniz . Let’s start with a simple example . We’re give the following integral to solve. ∫01x7−1ln⁡xdx \\int_0^1 \\frac{x^7-1}{\\ln{x}} dx ∫01​lnxx7−1​dx Traditional methods for this will not work, in fact Integral Calculator returns a numerical estimation as it’s unable to find a closed form solution. In this scenario we apply Feynman’s technique to solve the integral. First we parameterize the function I(α)=∫01x7α−1ln⁡xdx I(\\alpha) = \\int_0^1 \\frac{x^{7\\alpha}-1}{\\ln{x}} dx I(α)=∫01​lnxx7α−1​dx . We can see that our initial integral is equal to I(1)I(1)I(1) . We take the derivative of both sides with respect to the parameter. I′(α)=∂I∂α∫01x7α−1ln⁡xdx I&#x27;(\\alpha) = \\frac{\\partial I}{\\partial \\alpha}\\int_0^1 \\frac{x^{7\\alpha}-1}{\\ln{x}} dx I′(α)=∂α∂I​∫01​lnxx7α−1​dx Since the bounds of the integral are not functions of our parameter, and our function is continuous within said bound. We are able to “flip” the order of integration and differentiation .

This was a project developed by me and some friends at a local hackathon, the theme was “Privacy and Security” and we developed a platform that allowed users to change or delete media metadata. In addition we implemented functionality that identified and warned users about details in their images that could compromise their privacy. My Story . Solution The “Traceless” project, showcases my capabilities in full-stack web engineering and AI integration. As a member of the team I conceived and built this platform to grant users greater control over their metadata. In addition we implemented functionality that identified and warned users about details in their images that could compromise their privacy. My process involved leveraging Flask for the backend and React for a dynamic frontend, ensuring a cohesive and intuitive UX. A significant aspect of my work was the development and integration of a PyTorch-based AI model designed for image analysis, accurately identifying key visual features that could potentially give away important information (like license plates, street signs etc.). This model enhances user safety and privacy by allowing precise metadata control across diverse media types. The inclusion of “Traceless” in this portfolio demonstrates my strength in developing comprehensive, user-centric web applications from conception to implementation, effectively bridging the gap between sophisticated AI models and practical user functionalities.
