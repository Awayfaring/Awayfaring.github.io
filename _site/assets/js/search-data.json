[The answer to this puzzle is a single word.] . Original Puzzle Link . Here I will have the steps in which I do the puzzle, I will have drop downs including each of the steps, and the results. Solution First and foremost we see that the game pieces form letters. Using the game boxes/instructions in the back, we order the letter the game pieces form. | UNO: M | Catan: I | Risk: S | Monopoly: S | Dominion: I | Scrabble: N | Sushi Go: G | Chess: O | Clue: N | Stratego: E | Bananagrams: S | . We can see that the letters form the word “MISSINGONES”, and upon caferul observation you can realize that each of displayed pieces, have one “object” missing. Take UNO, UNO has 4 “categories” of cards, . | Red | Yellow | Green | Blue | . With a quick observation we can see that no Yellow cards were used in the construction of the “M”. We take that principle and apply it to the other games categories. | UNO: Green, Blue, Red, Yellow | Catan: Has 5 resource cards, of which Ore is missing. | Risk: All the teal colored are Asian countries/regions, of which Ural is missing | Monopoly: _____ | Dominion: Of the 7 Base resouce cards Silver is missing. | Scrabble: Of the 26 letters, U is Missing | Sushi Go: Of the base set cards the Nigiri card is missing. | Chess: The Kings for both black and white are missing. | Clue: _____ | Stratego: They have an older version of Stratego of which 8 -&gt; Miner is missing. | Bananagrams: Is Missing the letter Y. | . After a bit of looking you will realize that Monopoly and clue have no missing pieces and that would be correct. Inside our final answer we will treat those 2 as “Spaces”. In the order I presented (which was the same order in which we derived “MISSING ONES”), reading the first letter of every missing “one” would give us the phrase . “YOU SUNK MY _“ . Upon a quick search we find that “Battleship” is the missing word, and also our final answer. ",

    "content": "A niche technique for solving certain integrals that involves having the entire integral as a function of a newly created parameter . Not to be confused with Feynman’s Technique or Feynman Parametrization. In fact this method was originally derived by Leibniz . Let’s start with a simple example . Assume we have to solve the following integral. ∫01x7−1ln⁡xdx \\int_0^1 \\frac{x^7-1}{\\ln{x}} dx ∫01​lnxx7−1​dx Traditional methods for this will not work, in fact Integral Calculator returns a numerical estimation as it’s unable to find a closed form solution. First we parameterize the function I(α)=∫01x7α−1ln⁡xdx I(\\alpha) = \\int_0^1 \\frac{x^{7\\alpha}-1}{\\ln{x}} dx I(α)=∫01​lnxx7α−1​dx . We can see that our initial integral is equal to I(1)I(1)I(1) . We take the derivative of both sides with respect to the parameter. I′(α)=∂I∂α∫01x7α−1ln⁡xdx I&#x27;(\\alpha) = \\frac{\\partial I}{\\partial \\alpha}\\int_0^1 \\frac{x^{7\\alpha}-1}{\\ln{x}} dx I′(α)=∂α∂I​∫01​lnxx7α−1​dx Since the bounds of the integral are not functions of our parameter, and our function is continuous within said bound. We are able to “flip” the order of integration and differentiation . I′(α)=∫01∂I∂α (x7α−1ln⁡x) dx=∫017x7αln⁡xln⁡xdx=∫017x7αdx=7x7α+17α+1∣01=77α+1\\begin{aligned} I&#x27;(\\alpha) &amp;= \\int_0^1 \\frac{\\partial I}{\\partial \\alpha} \\ \\left(\\frac{x^{7\\alpha}-1}{\\ln{x}}\\right) \\ dx \\\\ &amp;= \\int_0^1 \\frac{7x^{7\\alpha}\\ln{x}}{\\ln{x}} dx \\\\ &amp;= \\int_0^1 7x^{7\\alpha} dx \\\\ &amp;= \\left. \\frac{7x^{7\\alpha + 1}}{7\\alpha + 1}\\right|_0^1 \\\\ &amp;= \\frac{7}{7\\alpha + 1} \\end{aligned}I′(α)​=∫01​∂α∂I​ (lnxx7α−1​) dx=∫01​lnx7x7αlnx​dx=∫01​7x7αdx=7α+17x7α+1​∣∣∣∣∣​01​=7α+17​​ . If we remember the fundamental theorem of calculus we know that . F(b)−F(a)=∫abf(x)dxwhere  f(x)=F′(x) F(b) - F(a) = \\int_a^b f(x) dx \\qquad \\text{where }\\ f(x) = F&#x27;(x) F(b)−F(a)=∫ab​f(x)dxwhere  f(x)=F′(x) Applying this to out context we can write that I(1)−I(0)=∫01I′(α) dα I(1) - I(0) = \\int_0^1 I&#x27;(\\alpha) \\ d\\alphaI(1)−I(0)=∫01​I′(α) dα From our original parameterization we see that if we set α=0\\alpha = 0α=0 I(0)=∫01x0−1ln⁡x=0I(0) = \\int_0^1 \\frac{x^{0}-1}{\\ln{x}}=0I(0)=∫01​lnxx0−1​=0 Therefore our equation becomes I(1)=∫01I′(α) dα=∫0177α+1 dα=ln⁡(7α+1)∣01=ln⁡8−ln⁡1=ln⁡8\\begin{aligned} I(1) &amp;= \\int_0^1 I&#x27;(\\alpha) \\ d\\alpha \\\\ &amp;= \\int_0^1 \\frac{7}{7\\alpha + 1} \\ d\\alpha \\\\ &amp;= \\left.\\ln{(7\\alpha + 1)} \\right|_0^1 \\\\ &amp;= \\ln{8} - \\ln{1} \\\\ &amp;= \\boxed{\\ln{8}} \\end{aligned}I(1)​=∫01​I′(α) dα=∫01​7α+17​ dα=ln(7α+1)∣01​=ln8−ln1=ln8​​ . Thus we arrive at our final answer ∫01x7−1ln⁡x dx=ln⁡8\\int_0^1 \\frac{x^7-1}{\\ln{x}}\\ dx = \\ln{8}∫01​lnxx7−1​ dx=ln8 . ",

You can easily set the created site to be published on GitHub Pages – the README file explains how to do that, along with other details. If Jekyll is installed on your computer, you can also build and preview the created site locally. This lets you test changes before committing them, and avoids waiting for GitHub Pages.1 And you will be able to deploy your local build to a different platform than GitHub Pages. More specifically, the created site: . | uses a gem-based approach, i.e. uses a Gemfile and loads the just-the-docs gem | uses the GitHub Pages / Actions workflow to build and publish the site on GitHub Pages | . Other than that, you’re free to customize sites that you create with this template, however you like. You can easily change the versions of just-the-docs and Jekyll it uses, as well as adding further plugins. Browse our documentation to learn more about how to use this theme. To get started with creating a site, simply: . | click “use this template” to create a GitHub repository | go to Settings &gt; Pages &gt; Build and deployment &gt; Source, and select GitHub Actions | . If you want to maintain your docs in the docs directory of an existing project repo, see Hosting your docs from an existing project repo in the template README. | It can take up to 10 minutes for changes to your site to publish after you push the changes to GitHub. &#8617; . | .
