Hello! I'm Jeremy a Computer Science at [University of Washington] student passionate about building software for personal entertainment and to solve real world problems. 

In the past I was a Game Developer on Everlune, I led content updates for 3,000+ monthly players, gaining valuable experience in teamwork and user-focused design. These experiences reflect my drive to build smart, efficient systems that make an impact.

At UW, I developed Python algorithms for neuron image analysis and noise reduction, improving data quality and processing efficiency. All with the goal of pushing research for CMT disease research

My recent projects explore AI/ML, including a PyTorch image analysis model (Traceless), a GPT-2 model built from scratch, and a face morphing and data sync system (Looking Glass).

I'm also currently exploring low level computer science through learning Rust and circuit design, I hope to use these skills to optimize my projects in the future.
